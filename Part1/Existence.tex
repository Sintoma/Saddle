\section{Existence of saddle-shaped solutions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{Sec:Existence}


In this section we establish the existence of saddle-shaped solutions to the integro-differential Allen-Cahn equation. The proof is based on the direct method of the calculus of variations, and it uses most of the results appearing in the previous sections.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{Th:Existence}]
Since $\ecal(w,B_R)$ is bounded from below ---by $0$---, we can take a minimizing sequence $u_R^j\in \widetilde{\H}^K_{0, \,\mathrm{odd}}(B_R)$. Note that, by Lemma~\ref{Lemma:DecreaseEnergy} we can assume that $-1 \leq u_R^j \leq 1$ and that $u_R^j \geq 0$ in $\ocal$ and $u_R^j \leq 0$ in $\ical$. 

Now, using $\eqref{Eq:Ellipticity}$, $G\geq 0$, and the fact that $u_R^j$ is a minimizing sequence, we deduce that 
$$
[u_R^j]^2_{H^\s(B_R)} \leq \dfrac{c_{n,\s}}{\lambda}  [u_R^j]^2_{\H^K(B_R)}\leq \dfrac{2 c_{n,\s}}{\lambda}\ecal(u_R^j,B_R) \leq C
$$
for a constant $C$ that does not depend on $j$. Therefore, by combining this with the fractional Poincaré inequality (recall that $u_R^j \equiv 0$ in $\R^{2m}\setminus B_R$) we get that the sequence $\{u_R^j\}$ is bounded in $H^\s(B_R)$. Hence, by the compact embedding $H^\s(B_R) \subset \subset L^2(B_R)$ (see Theorem~7.1 of \cite{HitchhikerGuide}), there exists a subsequence, still denoted by $u_R^j$,  that converges to some doubly radial $u_R \in L^2(B_R)$, and thus, a.e. in $B_R$. By Fatou's lemma, we have
$$
\ecal(u_R, B_R)
\leq \liminf_{j\to \infty} \ecal(u_R^j, B_R) = \inf \setcond{\ecal(w, B_R)}{w \in \widetilde{\H}^K_{0, \,\mathrm{odd}}(B_R)}.
$$
Therefore, $u_R \in \widetilde{\H}^K(B_R)$. In addition, $u_R(x) = - u_R(x^\star)$ for every $x\in \R^{2m}$, and $u_R \equiv 0 $ in $\R^{2m} \setminus B_R$. Thus, $u_R$ is a minimizer of $\ecal(\cdot, B_R)$ in $\widetilde{\H}^K_{0, \,\mathrm{odd}}(B_R)$. Moreover, it satisfies $-1\leq u_R \leq 1$ in $B_R$ and $u_R\geq 0$ in $\ocal$.

Arguing exactly as in the proof of Theorem~\ref{Th:EnergyEstimate} (using Proposition~\ref{Prop:WeakSolutionForAllTestFunctions}), we deduce that $u_R$ is a classical solution to
\begin{equation*}
%\label{Eq:ProofExistenceProblemBR}
	\beqc{\PDEsystem}
	L_K  u_R &=& f(u_R) & \textrm{ in } B_R\,,\\
	u_R &=& 0 & \textrm{ in }\R^{2m} \setminus B_R.
	\eeqc
\end{equation*}


The next step is to pass to the limit in $R$ to obtain a solution in $\R^{2m}$. This is done using a compactness argument. Let $S>0$ and consider the family $\{u_R\}$, for $R> S + 1$, of solutions to $L_K u_R = f(u_R)$ in $B_{S}$. Note first that, if $w$ solves $L_K w = f(w)$ in $B_\rho$ and  $|w|\leq 1$ in $\R^{2m}$ with $f\in C^{\alpha}([-1,1])$ for some $\alpha > 0$, the combination of \eqref{Eq:C2sEstimate} and \eqref{Eq:Calpha->Calpha+2sEstimateBalls} yields
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:UniformC2alphaEstimateBalls}
\norm{w}_{C^{2\s + \varepsilon}(B_{\rho/8})} \leq C \bpar{n,\ \s ,\ \lambda,\ \Lambda ,\ \norm{f}_{C^{\alpha}([-1,1])} }\,.
\end{equation}
for some $\varepsilon > 0$.  By applying the estimate \eqref{Eq:UniformC2alphaEstimateBalls} to $u_R$ in balls of radius $\rho = 1$ and centered at points in $\overline{B_{S}}$, we obtain a uniform $C^{2\s + \varepsilon}(\overline{B_S})$ bound for $u_R$. By the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, as $R\to +\infty$, a subsequence of $\{u_R\}$ converges in $C^{2\s + \varepsilon/2}(\overline{B_S})$ to a (pointwise) solution in $B_S$. Taking now $S = 1,2,3,\ldots$ and using a diagonal argument, we obtain a sequence $u_{R_j}$ converging uniformly on compacts in the $C^{2\s + \varepsilon/2}$ norm to a solution $u \in C^{2\s + \varepsilon/2}(\R^{2m})$ of \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}.

Therefore, we have obtained a solution $u$ to $L_K u = f(u)$ in $\R^{2m}$ which is doubly radial. Furthermore, $u$ is odd with respect to the Simons cone $\ccal$, i.e., $u(x) = -u(x^\star)$ for $x\in \R^{2m}$, and $0 \leq u\leq 1$ in $\ocal$.

Finally, we show that $0<u<1$ in $\ocal$. This will ensure that $u$ is a saddle-shaped solution. First, note that $|u| < 1$ by the usual strong maximum principle (since $u$ vanishes at $\ccal$ and is continuous, we have $u \not \equiv 1$  and $u\not\equiv -1$ in $\R^{2m}$). Let us show that $u\not\equiv 0$. To do this, we use the energy estimate of Theorem~\ref{Th:EnergyEstimate}. That is, if we consider $u_R$ the minimizer of $\ecal(\cdot, B_R)$ with $R > 8$, we have
$$
\ecal (u_R,B_S) \leq \begin{cases}
C \ S^{2m-2\s}\ \ \ \ &\textrm{if } \ \ \s\in(0,1/2),\\
C\ \log(S)\,S^{2m-2\s}\ \ \ \ &\textrm{if } \ \ \s=1/2,\\
C \ S^{2m-1}\ \ \ \ &\textrm{if } \ \ \s\in(1/2,1),\\
\end{cases} $$
for every $2 < S < R-5$ and with a constant $C$ independent of $R$ and $S$. By letting $R \to \infty$ we obtain the same estimate for $u$. By contradiction, assume $u\equiv 0$. Then, the previous estimate leads to
$$
c_m G(0)S^{2m} = \ecal(0, B_S) \leq \begin{cases}
C \ S^{2m-2\s}\ \ \ \ &\textrm{if } \ \ \s\in(0,1/2),\\
C\ \log(S)\,S^{2m-2\s}\ \ \ \ &\textrm{if } \ \ \s=1/2,\\
C \ S^{2m-1}\ \ \ \ &\textrm{if } \ \ \s\in(1/2,1),\\
\end{cases} $$
and, since $G(0)>0$, this is a contradiction for $S$ large enough. Therefore, $u \not \equiv 0$ and the strong maximum principle for odd functions (see Proposition~\ref{Prop:StrongMaximumPrincipleForOddFunctions}) yields that $u>0$ in $\ocal$. 
\end{proof}
