\section{Rotation invariant operators acting on doubly radial odd functions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{Sec:OperatorOddF}

This section is devoted to study rotation invariant operators of the class $\lcal_0$ when they act on doubly radial odd functions. First, we deduce an alternative expression for the operator in terms of a doubly radial kernel $\overline{K}$. Then, we present necessary and sufficient conditions on the kernel $K$ in order to \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality} hold (we establish Theorem~\ref{Th:SufficientNecessaryConditions}). Finally, we show two maximum principles for doubly radial odd functions (Proposition~\ref{Prop:MaximumPrincipleForOddFunctions}).

\subsection{Alternative expressions for the operator $L_K$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The main purpose of this subsection is to deduce an alternative expression for a rotation invariant operator $L_K \in \lcal_0$ acting on doubly radial functions. This expression is more suitable to work with and it will be used throughout the paper. Our first remark is that if $w$ is invariant by $O(m)^2$, the same holds for $L_Kw$. Indeed, for every $R \in O(m)^2$,
\begin{align*}
L_K w (Rx)
& = \int_{\R^{2m}} \{w(Rx) - w(y)\} K(|Rx - y|)  \d y\\
& = \int_{\R^{2m}} \{w(Rx) - w(R\tilde{y})\} K(|Rx - R\tilde{y}|) \d \tilde{y}\\
& = \int_{\R^{2m}} \{w(x) - w(\tilde{y})\} K(|x-\tilde{y}|) \d \tilde{y}\\
& = L_K w (x)\,.
\end{align*}
Here we have used the change $y = R\tilde{y}$ and the fact that $w(R \cdot) = w(\cdot)$ for every $R\in O(m)^2$.

Next, we present an alternative expression for the operator $L_K $ acting on doubly radial functions. This expression involves the new kernel $\overline{K}$, which is also doubly radial.

\begin{lemma} \label{Lemma:AlternativeOperatorExpression}
Let $L_K \in \lcal_0(2m,\s)$ have a radially symmetric kernel $K$, and let $w$ be a doubly radial function such that $L_K w$ is well-defined. Then, $L_K w$ can be expressed as
$$
L_K w(x) = \int_{\R^{2m}} \{w(x) - w(y)\} \overline{K}(x,y) \d y
$$
where $\overline{K}$ is symmetric, invariant by $O(m)^2$ in both arguments, and it is defined by
\begin{equation*}
%\label{Eq:KbarDef}
\overline{K}(x,y) := \average_{O(m)^2} K(|Rx - y|)\d R\,.
\end{equation*}
Here, $\d R$ denotes integration with respect to the Haar measure on $O(m)^2$.
\end{lemma}

Recall (see for instance \cite{Nachbin}) that the Haar measure on $O(m)^2$ exists and it is unique up to a
multiplicative constant. Let us state next the properties of this measure that will be used in the rest of the
paper. In the following, the Haar measure is denoted by $\mu$. First, since $O(m)^2$ is a compact
group, it is unimodular (see Chapter~II, Proposition~ 13 of \cite{Nachbin}). As a consequence, the
measure $\mu$ is left and right invariant, that is, $\mu(R\Sigma) = \mu(\Sigma) = \mu(\Sigma R) $
for every subset $\Sigma \subset O(m)^2$ and every $R\in O(m)^2$. Moreover, it holds
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:Unimodular}
\average_{O(m)^2} g(R^{-1}) \d R = \average_{O(m)^2} g(R) \d R
\end{equation}	
for every $g\in L^1(O(m)^2)$ ---see \cite{Nachbin} for the details.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{Lemma:AlternativeOperatorExpression}]
Since $L_K w (x) = L_K w (Rx)$ for every $R\in O(m)^2$, by taking the mean over all the transformations in $O(m)^2$, we get
\begin{align*}
L_K w(x) &= \average_{O(m)^2} L_K w(Rx)\d R =  \average_{O(m)^2} \int_{\R^{2m}} \{w(x) - w(y)\}K(|Rx - y|) \d y \d R\\
&= \int_{\R^{2m}} \{w(x) - w(y)\}  \average_{O(m)^2} K(|Rx - y|) \d R  \d y \\
&= \int_{\R^{2m}} \{w(x) - w(y)\}  \overline{K}(x,y) \d y\,.
\end{align*}
Now, we show that $\overline{K}$ is symmetric. Using property \eqref{Eq:Unimodular}, we get
\begin{align*}
\overline{K}(y,x) &= \average_{O(m)^2} K(|R y - x|)\d R = \average_{O(m)^2} K(|R^{-1} (R y - x)|)\d R \\
&= \average_{O(m)^2} K(|R^{-1}x-y)|)\d R = \overline{K}(x,y)\,.
\end{align*}
It remains to show that
$\overline{K}$ is invariant by $O(m)^2$ in its two arguments. By the symmetry, it is enough to
check it for the first one. Let $\tilde{R} \in O(m)^2$. Then,
$$
\overline{K} (\tilde{R}x, y) = \average_{O(m)^2} K(|R \tilde{R} x - y|)\d R  = \average_{O(m)^2} K(|R x - y|)\d R = \overline{K} (x, y)\,,
$$
where we have used the right invariance of the Haar measure.
\end{proof}



In the following lemma we present some properties of the involution $(\cdot)^\star$ defined by \eqref{Eq:DefStar} and its relation with the doubly radial kernel $\overline{K}$ and the transformations of $O(m)^2$. In particular, in the proof of Theorem~\ref{Th:SufficientNecessaryConditions} it will be useful to consider the following transformation. For every $R\in O(m)^2$, we define  $R_\star\in O(m)^2$ by 
\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:DefRStar}
	R_\star := (R(\cdot)^\star)^\star\,.
\end{equation}
Equivalently, if $R = (R_1, R_2)$ with $R_1$, $R_2 \in O(m)$, then $R_\star = (R_2, R_1)$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{Lemma:PropertiesStar}
Let $(\cdot)^\star: \R^{2m} \to \R^{2m}$ be the involution defined by $x^\star = (x',x'')^\star = (x'', x')$
---see \eqref{Eq:DefStar}.
Then,
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The Haar integral on $O(m)^2$ has the following invariance:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:InvarianceByStar}
\int_{O(m)^2} g(R_\star) \d R = \int_{O(m)^2} g(R) \d R \,,
\end{equation}
for every $g \in L^1(O(m)^2)$.
\item $\overline{K}(x^\star,y) = \overline{K} (x,y^\star)$. As a consequence, $\overline{K}(x^\star,y^\star) = \overline{K} (x,y)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The first statement is easy to check by using Fubini:
\begin{align*}
\int_{O(m)^2} g(R_\star) \d R & = \int_{O(m)} \!\! \d R_1 \int_{O(m)} \!\! \d R_2 \ \ g(R_2, R_1)  =  \int_{O(m)} \!\! \d R_2 \int_{O(m)} \!\! \d R_1 \ \ g(R_2, R_1) \\
& =  \int_{O(m)} \!\! \d R_1 \int_{O(m)} \!\! \d R_2 \ \ g(R_1, R_2)  =  \int_{O(m)^2} g(R) \d R\,.
\end{align*}

To show the second statement, we use the definition of $R_\star$ and \eqref{Eq:InvarianceByStar}
to see that
\begin{align*}
\overline{K}(x^\star,y) &= \average_{O(m)^2} K(|Rx^\star - y|) \d R = \average_{O(m)^2} K(|(Rx^\star - y)^\star|) \d R \\
&= \average_{O(m)^2} K(|(R x^\star)^\star - y^\star|) \d R = \average_{O(m)^2} K(|R_\star x - y^\star|) \d R \\
&= \average_{O(m)^2} K(|Rx - y^\star|) \d R = \overline{K}(x,y^\star)\,.
\end{align*}
As a consequence, we have that $\overline{K}(x^\star,y^\star) = \overline{K}(x,(y^\star)^\star) = \overline{K}(x,y)$.
\end{proof}

To conclude this subsection, we present two alternative expressions for the operator $L_K$ when it acts on doubly radial odd functions. These expressions are suitable in the rest of the paper and also in the forthcoming one \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialII}, since the integrals appearing in the expression are computed only in $\ocal$, and this is important to prove maximum principle and other properties.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{Lemma:OperatorOddF}
	Let $w$ be a doubly radial function which is odd with respect to the Simons cone. Let $L_K \in \lcal_0(2m,\s,\lambda, \Lambda)$ be a rotation invariant operator and let $L_K^\ocal$ be defined by \eqref{Eq:OperatorOddF}. 
	
	Then, 
	\begin{align*}
	L_K w (x) &= \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) - w(y) \} \overline{K}(x, y) \d y +  \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) + w(y) \} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y \\
	&= \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) - w(y) \} \{\overline{K}(x, y) - \overline{K}(x, y^\star)  \} \d y +  2 w(x) \int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y \,.
	\end{align*}
	In particular, the second equality shows that $L_K w (x) = L_K^\ocal w(x)$. 	Moreover,
	\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:ZeroOrderTerm}
		\dfrac{1}{C} \dist(x,\ccal)^{-2\s} \leq \int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y \leq C \dist(x,\ccal)^{-2\s},
	\end{equation}
	where $C>0$ is a constant depending only on $m, \s, \lambda$, and $\Lambda$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The first statement is just a computation. Indeed,  using the change of variables  $\bar{y} = y^\star$ and the odd symmetry of $w$, we see that
	\begin{align*}
	\int_{\ical}  \{w(x) - w(y) \} \overline{K}(x, y)\d y &= \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) - w(y^\star) \}\overline{K}(x, y^\star)\d y \\
	&= \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) + w(y) \}\overline{K}(x, y^\star)\d y\,.
	\end{align*}
	Hence,
	\begin{align*}
	L_K w (x) &= \int_{\R^{2m}}  \{w(x) - w(y) \} \overline{K}(x, y)\d y \\
	&= \int_{\ocal}  \{w(x) - w(y) \} \overline{K}(x, y)\d y +\int_{\ical}  \{w(x) - w(y) \} \overline{K}(x, y)\d y \\
	&= \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) - w(y) \} \overline{K}(x, y) \d y +  \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) + w(y) \} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y \,.
	\end{align*}
	By adding and subtracting $w(x)\overline{K}(x, y^\star)$ in the last integrand, we immediately deduce
	$$
	L_K w (x) =  \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) - w(y) \} \{\overline{K}(x, y) - \overline{K}(x, y^\star)  \} \d y +  2 w(x) \int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y\,.
	$$
	Note that we can add and subtract the term $w(x)\overline{K}(x, y^\star)$  since it is integrable with respect to $y$ in $\ocal$. This is a consequence of \eqref{Eq:ZeroOrderTerm}.
	
	Let us show now \eqref{Eq:ZeroOrderTerm}. In the following arguments we will use the letters $C$ and $c$ to denote positive constants, depending only on $m, \s, \lambda$, and $\Lambda$, that may change its value in each inequality. 
	
	On the one hand, for the upper bound in \eqref{Eq:ZeroOrderTerm} we only need to use the ellipticity of the kernel and the inclusion $\ical \subset \{y\in\R^{2m}:|x-y|\geq \dist(x,\ccal)\}$ for every $x\in \ocal$. Indeed,
	\begin{align*}
	\int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y &=  \int_{\ocal} K(|x-y^\star|) \d y = \int_{\ical} K(|x-y|) \d y \leq \int_{|x-y|\geq \dist(x,\ccal)} K(|x-y|) \d y \\
	&\leq C \int_{|x-y|\geq \dist(x,\ccal)} |x-y|^{-2m-2\s} \d y = C \int_{\dist(x,\ccal)}^\infty \rho^{-1-2s} \d \rho \\
	&= C \dist(x,\ccal)^{-2s}\,.
	\end{align*}

	On the other hand, for the lower bound in \eqref{Eq:ZeroOrderTerm}, let be $\overline{x}\in \ccal$ such that $|x-\overline{x}|=\dist(x,\ccal)$. Then, given $y\in B_{\dist(x,\ccal)}(\overline{x})$, it is clear that $|x-y|\leq |x-\overline{x}|+|\overline{x}-y|\leq 2\dist(x,\ccal)$. Therefore, we have
	\begin{align*}
	\int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y &=  \int_{\ical} K(|x-y|) \d y \geq c \int_{\ical} |x-y|^{-2m-2\s} \d y \\
	&\geq c \int_{B_{\dist(x,\ccal)}(\overline{x})\cap \ical} |x-y|^{-2m-2\s} \d y\\
	&\geq c \, (2\dist(x,\ccal))^{-2m-2\s} |B_{\dist(x,\ccal)}(\overline{x})\cap \ical| = c \,\dist(x,\ccal)^{-2\s}.
	\end{align*}
	Here we have used a property of the Simons cone: $|B_R(z)\cap \ical|=1/2|B_R|$ for every $z\in \ccal$ (see Lemma 2.5 in \cite{Felipe-Sanz-Perela:SaddleFractional} for the proof).
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Necessary and sufficient conditions for ellipticity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%




In this subsection, we establish Theorem~\ref{Th:SufficientNecessaryConditions}. As we have mentioned in the introduction, the kernel inequality \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality} is crucial in the rest of the results of this paper, as well as in the ones in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialII}. We will see in the next subsection that this inequality guarantees that the operator $L_K$ has a maximum principle for odd functions (see Proposition~\ref{Prop:MaximumPrincipleForOddFunctions}).

First, we give a sufficient condition on a radially symmetric kernel $K$ so that $\overline{K}$ satisfies \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality}. It is the following result.

\begin{proposition}
\label{Prop:KernelInequalitySufficientCondition} 
Let $K:(0,+\infty) \to \R$ define a positive radially symmetric kernel $K(|x-y|)$ in $\R^{2m}$. Define $\overline{K} : \R^{2m}\times \R^{2m} \to \R$ by \eqref{Eq:KbarDef'}. Assume that $K(\sqrt{\cdot})$ is strictly convex in $(0,+\infty)$. Then, the associated kernel $\overline{K}$ satisfies
	\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:KernelInequalityBis}
	\overline{K}(x,y) > \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \quad \text{ for every }x,y \in \ocal\,.
	\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since $\overline{K}$ is invariant by $O(m)^2$, it is enough to choose a unitary vector $e \in \Sph^{m-1}$ and show \eqref{Eq:KernelInequalityBis} for points $x, y\in \ocal$ of the form $x = (|x'|e, |x''|e)$ and $y = (|y'|e, |y''|e)$.

Now, define
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:DefQ}
	\begin{split}
	Q_1 &:= \setcond{R = (R_1,R_2) \in O(m)^2}{e\cdot R_1 e > |e\cdot R_2 e|},\\
	Q_2 &:= \setcond{R = (R_1,R_2) \in O(m)^2}{e\cdot R_2 e > |e\cdot R_1 e|} = (Q_1)_\star,\\
	Q_3 &:= \setcond{R = (R_1,R_2) \in O(m)^2}{e\cdot R_1 e < -|e\cdot R_2 e|} = -Q_1,\\
	Q_4 &:= \setcond{R = (R_1,R_2) \in O(m)^2}{e\cdot R_2 e < - |e\cdot R_1 e|} = -(Q_1)_\star.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
Recall that given $R=(R_1,R_2)\in O(m)^2$, then $R_\star=(R_2,R_1)\in O(m)^2$ ---see \eqref{Eq:DefRStar}. Moreover, note that the sets $Q_i$ are disjoint, have the same measure and cover all $O(m)^2$ up to a set of measure zero. 

%Moreover, they satisfy the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item If $R = (R_1, R_2)\in Q_2$, then $R_\star = (R_2, R_1) \in Q_1$.
%\item If $R = (R_1, R_2)\in Q_3$, then $-R = (-R_1, -R_2) \in Q_1$.
%\item If $R = (R_1, R_2)\in Q_4$, then $-R_\star = (-R_2, -R_1) \in Q_1$.
%\end{itemize}
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
4\overline{K} (x, y) &= 4\average_{O(m)^2} K(|x - R y|)\d R \\
& = \average_{Q_1} K(|x - R y|)\d R + \average_{Q_2} K(|x - R y|)\d R \\
& \quad \quad
+ \average_{Q_3} K(|x - R y|)\d R +
\average_{Q_4} K(|x - R y|)\d R \\
&= \average_{Q_1} \{K(|x - R y|) + K(|x + R y|) \\
&\quad \quad + K(|x - R_\star y|) + K(|x + R_\star y|)\}\d R
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
4\overline{K} (x, y^\star) &= 4\average_{O(m)^2} K(|x - R y^\star|)\d R \\
& = \average_{Q_1} \{K(|x - R y^\star|) + K(|x + R y^\star|) \\
&\quad \quad + K(|x - R_\star y^\star|) + K(|x + R_\star y^\star|)\}\d R.
\end{align*}
Thus, if we prove
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof}
\begin{split}
K(|x - R y|) + K(|x + R y|) + K(|x - R_\star y|) + K(|x + R_\star y|)
\quad \quad \quad \quad 
\\
\geq
K(|x - R y^\star|) + K(|x + R y^\star|)+K(|x - R_\star y^\star|) + K(|x + R_\star y^\star|)\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
for every $R\in Q_1$, we immediately deduce \eqref{Eq:KernelInequalityBis} with a non strict inequality. To see that it is indeed a strict one, we will show that the inequality in \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof} is strict for every $R \in Q_1$.


For a short notation, we call
\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:DefAlphaBeta}
	\alpha := e \cdot R_1 e  \quad \text{ and } \quad \beta := e \cdot R_2 e\,.
\end{equation}
Now, note that since  $x = (|x'|e, |x''|e)$ and $y = (|y'|e, |y''|e)$, we have
\begin{align*}
|x \pm Ry|^2&= |x' \pm R_1y'|^2 + |x'' \pm R_2y''|^2 \\
&= |x'|^2 + |y'|^2 \pm 2 x'\cdot R_1 y' +  |x''|^2 + |y''|^2 \pm 2 x''\cdot R_2 y''\\
&= |x|^2 + |y|^2 \pm 2 |x'||y'| \alpha \pm 2 |x''||y''| \beta.
\end{align*}
Similarly,
$$
|x \pm R_\star y|^2 =  |x|^2 + |y|^2 \pm 2 |x'||y'| \beta \pm 2 |x''||y''|\alpha,
$$
$$
|x \pm R y^\star|^2 =  |x|^2 + |y|^2 \pm 2 |x'||y''| \alpha \pm 2 |x''||y'|\beta,
$$
and
$$
|x \pm R_\star y^\star|^2 = |x|^2 + |y|^2 \pm 2 |x'||y''| \beta \pm 2 |x''||y'| \alpha.
$$

We define now
$$
g(\tau) := K \bpar{\sqrt{|x|^2 + |y|^2 + 2 \tau }} + K \bpar{\sqrt{|x|^2 + |y|^2 - 2 \tau}}.
$$
Thus, proving \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof} is equivalent to show that, for every $\alpha$, $\beta \in [-1,1]$ such that $\alpha > |\beta|$, it holds
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof2}
\begin{split}
g\Big(|x'||y'| \alpha + |x''||y''| \beta \Big)
+ g\Big(|x'||y'| \beta + |x''||y''| \alpha \Big) \hspace{2cm}
\\ \geq
g\Big(|x'||y''| \alpha + |x''||y'|\beta \Big)
+ g\Big(|x'||y''| \beta + |x''||y'| \alpha \Big)\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Let
$$
\begin{array}{cc}
A_{\alpha,\beta} := |x'||y'|  \alpha + |x''||y''|\beta \,, &
B_{\alpha,\beta} := |x'||y''| \alpha + |x''||y'| \beta \,, \\
C_{\alpha,\beta} := |x''||y'| \alpha + |x'||y''| \beta \,, &
D_{\alpha,\beta} := |x''||y''|\alpha + |x'||y'|  \beta \,.
\end{array}
$$
With this notation and taking into account that $g$ is even,
\eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof2} is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof3}
g(|A_{\alpha,\beta}|) + g(|D_{\alpha,\beta}|) \geq g(|C_{\alpha,\beta}|) + g(|B_{\alpha,\beta}|)\,,
\end{equation}
for every $\alpha$, $\beta \in [-1,1]$ such that $\alpha > |\beta|$. Note that $g$ is defined in the open interval $I = (-(|x|^2 + |y|^2)/2,\ (|x|^2 + |y|^2)/2)$ and that $A_{\alpha,\beta}$, $B_{\alpha,\beta}$, $C_{\alpha,\beta}$, $D_{\alpha,\beta} \in I$.

To show \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof3}, we use Proposition~\ref{Prop:EquivalenceK(sqrt)Convex<->Inequality} of the Appendix~\ref{Sec:AuxiliaryResults}. There, it is stated that in order to establish \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof3} it is enough to check that
$$
\begin{cases}
|A_{\alpha,\beta}| \geq |B_{\alpha,\beta}|,\ \ |A_{\alpha,\beta}| \geq |C_{\alpha,\beta}|, \ \ |A_{\alpha,\beta}| \geq |D_{\alpha,\beta}|\,, \\
|A_{\alpha,\beta}| + |D_{\alpha,\beta}| \geq |B_{\alpha,\beta}| + |C_{\alpha,\beta}|\,.
\end{cases}
$$
The verification of these inequalities is a simple but tedious computation and it is presented in Appendix~\ref{Sec:AuxiliaryResults2} ---see point (1) of Lemma~\ref{Lemma:ComputationABCD}. Once this is proved, we deduce \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof3} by Proposition~\ref{Prop:EquivalenceK(sqrt)Convex<->Inequality}.

To finish, we see that the inequality in \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof3} is always strict for every $\alpha$, $\beta \in [-1,1]$ such that $\alpha > |\beta|$ (that corresponds to $Q_1$). By contradiction, assume that equality holds in \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof3}. Thus, by Proposition~\ref{Prop:EquivalenceK(sqrt)Convex<->Inequality}, if follows that the sets $\{|A_{\alpha,\beta}|, |D_{\alpha,\beta}|\} $ and $\{|B_{\alpha,\beta}|,|C_{\alpha,\beta}|\}$ coincide. This fact and point (2) of Lemma~\ref{Lemma:ComputationABCD} yield $\alpha = \beta = 0$, a contradiction. Thus, the inequality in \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof3} is strict, as well as the inequality in \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof}. This leads to \eqref{Eq:KernelInequalityBis}.
\end{proof}


Now, we give a necessary condition on the kernel $K$ so that inequality \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality} holds.

\begin{proposition}
\label{Prop:KernelInequalityNecessaryCondition} Let $K:(0,+\infty) \to \R$ define a positive radially symmetric kernel $K(|x-y|)$ in $\R^{2m}$. Define $\overline{K} : \R^{2m}\times \R^{2m} \to \R$ by \eqref{Eq:KbarDef'}. 

If
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:KernelInequalityAE}
\overline{K}(x,y) > \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \quad \text{ for almost every }x,y \in \mathcal{O}\,,
\end{equation}
then $K(\sqrt{\cdot})$ cannot be concave in any open interval $I\subset [0,+\infty)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
It suffices to show that if there exists an open interval where $K(\sqrt{\cdot})$ is concave, then we can find a nonempty open set in $\ocal \times \ocal$ where \eqref{Eq:KernelInequalityAE} is not satisfied.

Let $\ell_2>\ell_1>0$ be such that $K(\sqrt{\cdot})$ is concave in $(\ell_1,\ell_2)$ and define the set $\Omega_{\ell_1,\ell_2}\subset \R^{4m}$ as the points $(x,y)\in \ocal\times \ocal$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:OmegaSetDefinition}
\beqc{\PDEsystem}
(|x'|-|y'|)^2+(|x''|-|y''|)^2&>&\ell_1,\\
(|x'|+|y'|)^2+(|x''|+|y''|)^2&<&\ell_2.
\eeqc
\end{equation}

First, it is easy to see that $\Omega_{\ell_1,\ell_2}$ is a nonempty open set. In fact, points of the form $(x',0,y',0)\in (\R^m)^4$ such that $(|x'|-|y'|)^2>\ell_1$ and $(|x'|+|y'|)^2 <\ell_2$ belong to $\Omega_{\ell_1,\ell_2}$. 

We need to prove that $\overline{K}(x,y) \leq \overline{K}(x, y^\star)$ in $\Omega_{\ell_1,\ell_2}$ for any $(x,y)\in \ocal\times \ocal$ satisfying \eqref{Eq:OmegaSetDefinition}. For such points, we are going to show, as in the previous proof, that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof4}
\begin{split}
K(|x - R y|) + K(|x + R y|) + K(|x - R_\star y|) + K(|x + R_\star y|)
\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad

\end{split}
\end{equation}
for any $R\in Q_1$, where $Q_1$ is defined in \eqref{Eq:DefQ} (see the proof of Proposition~\ref{Prop:KernelInequalitySufficientCondition}). As before, we can assume that $x$ and $y$ are of the form $x = (|x'|e, |x''|e)$ and $y = (|y'|e, |y''|e)$, with $e \in \Sph^{m-1}$ an arbitrary unitary vector. Then, by defining $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as in \eqref{Eq:DefAlphaBeta}, we see that proving \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof4} is equivalent to establish that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof5}
g(A_{\alpha,\beta}) + g(D_{\alpha,\beta}) \leq g(B_{\alpha,\beta}) + g(C_{\alpha,\beta})\,,
\end{equation}
for every $\alpha, \beta \in [-1,1]$ such that $\alpha>|\beta|$, where
$$
\begin{array}{cc}
A_{\alpha,\beta} = |x'||y'|  \alpha + |x''||y''|\beta \,, &
B_{\alpha,\beta} = |x'||y''| \alpha + |x''||y'| \beta \,, \\
C_{\alpha,\beta} = |x''||y'| \alpha + |x'||y''| \beta \,, &
D_{\alpha,\beta} = |x''||y''|\alpha + |x'||y'|  \beta \,.
\end{array}
$$
and
\begin{align*}
g(\tau) &= K\left( \sqrt{|x|^2+|y|^2+2\tau} \right) + K\left( \sqrt{|x|^2+|y|^2-2\tau} \right).
\end{align*}



Now, by \eqref{Eq:OmegaSetDefinition}, we have $\ell_1 < |x|^2+|y|^2 <\ell_2$. As a consequence of this and the concavity of $K(\sqrt{\cdot})$ in $(\ell_1,\ell_2)$, it is easy to see (by using Lemma~\ref{Lemma:ConvexFunctions} stated for $-h$, a concave function, instead of $h$) that $g$ is concave in $ \left( -\overline{\ell}, \overline{\ell}\right) $, and decreasing in $(0,\overline{\ell})$, where 
$$
\overline{\ell} := \min{\left\{\frac{\ell_2-|x|^2-|y|^2}{2},\frac{|x|^2+|y|^2-\ell_1}{2}\right\}}.$$
Note that, since $\ell_1 < |x|^2+|y|^2 <\ell_2$, we have $\overline{\ell}>0$.


We claim that $A_{\alpha,\beta}, B_{\alpha,\beta}, C_{\alpha,\beta}$, and $D_{\alpha,\beta}$ belong to $(-\overline{\ell},\overline{\ell})$ for every $\alpha, \beta \in [-1,1]$ such that $\alpha>|\beta|$. Indeed, it is easy to check that for every $\alpha, \beta \in [-1,1]$ such that $\alpha>|\beta|$, the numbers $A_{\alpha,\beta}, B_{\alpha,\beta}, C_{\alpha,\beta}$, and $D_{\alpha,\beta}$ belong to the open interval $(-|x'||y'|-|x''||y''|,|x'||y'|+|x''||y''|)$. Furthermore, since $x,y \in \Omega_{\ell_1,\ell_2}$, we obtain from \eqref{Eq:OmegaSetDefinition} that
$$
\beqc{\PDEsystem}
|x'||y'|+|x''||y''|&<&\dfrac{\ell_2-|x|^2-|y|^2}{2}\\
|x'||y'|+|x''||y''|&<&\dfrac{|x|^2+|y|^2-\ell_1}{2}
\eeqc 
$$
and thus $ |x'||y'|+|x''||y''|<\overline{\ell}$ and the claim is proved.

Finally, by applying Lemma~\ref{Lemma:ConvexFunctions} to the function $-g$ in $(0,\overline{\ell})$ (using again  point (1) of Lemma~\ref{Lemma:ComputationABCD}), we obtain that inequality \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof5} is satisfied, which yields \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof4}. Finally, by integrating \eqref{Eq:InequalityIntegrandKernelInequalityProof4} with respect to all the rotations $R\in Q_1$ we get $$ \overline{K}(x,y) \leq \overline{K}(x, y^\star),$$ for every $(x,y)\in \Omega_{\ell_1,\ell_2}$, contradicting \eqref{Eq:KernelInequalityAE}.
\end{proof}

From the two previous results, Theorem~\ref{Th:SufficientNecessaryConditions} follows immediately.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{Th:SufficientNecessaryConditions}]
	The first statement is exactly the same as Proposition~\ref{Prop:KernelInequalitySufficientCondition}. Assume now that $K$ is a $C^2$ function and that \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality} holds. Then, by Proposition~\ref{Prop:KernelInequalityNecessaryCondition}, $h(\cdot) := K(\sqrt{\cdot})$ is not concave in any interval of $[0,+\infty)$. Therefore, we cannot have $h''<0$ at any point. Thus, $h''\geq 0$ in $[0,+\infty)$ or, in other words, $h'$ is nondecreasing. Using again that $h$ is not concave in any interval, we deduce that $h'$ must be, in fact, increasing. It follows that $h(\cdot) = K(\sqrt{\cdot})$ is strictly convex as defined after the statement of Theorem~\ref{Th:SufficientNecessaryConditions}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	Note that a priori we cannot relax the $K\in C^2$ assumption in the necessary condition of Theorem~\ref{Th:SufficientNecessaryConditions}, since there are $C^1$ functions that are neither convex nor concave in any interval (they can be constructed as a primitive of a Weierstrass function, whose graph is a non rectifiable curve with fractal dimension). Besides these ``exotic'' examples, there are also simple radially symmetric kernels $K$ that are not $C^1$ for which we do not know if the positivity condition \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality} holds. For instance, given $0<\s<1$, if we consider the kernel
	$$ K(\tau) = \frac{1}{\tau^{2m+2\s}} \chi_{(0,1)}(\tau)+\frac{1}{10\tau^{2m+2\s}-9} \chi_{[1,+\infty)}(\tau), $$
	it is easy to check that $K$ is continuous and decreasing but $K(\sqrt{\tau})$ is not convex in $(0,+\infty)$ even though it does not have any interval of concavity (see Figure~\ref{Fig:Grafica}).

\subsection{Maximum principles for doubly radial odd functions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this subsection we prove Proposition~\ref{Prop:MaximumPrincipleForOddFunctions}, a weak and a strong maximum principles for doubly radial functions that are odd with respect to the Simons cone. The formulation of these maximum principles is very suitable since all the hypotheses refer to the set $\ocal$ and not $\R^{2m}$. The key ingredient in the proofs is the kernel inequality \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality}.


\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{Prop:MaximumPrincipleForOddFunctions}]
 $(i)$ By contradiction, suppose that $u$ takes negative values in $\Omega$. Under the hypotheses we are assuming, a negative minimum must be achieved. Thus, there exists $x_0\in \Omega$ such that
$$
u(x_0) = \min_{\Omega} u =: m < 0\,.
$$
Then, using the expression of $L_K$ for odd functions (see Lemma~\ref{Lemma:OperatorOddF}), we have
$$
L_K u (x_0) = \int_{\ocal} \{m - u(y) \} \{\overline{K}(x_0, y) - \overline{K}(x_0, y^\star)  \} \d y +  2 m \int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x_0, y^\star) \d y\,.
$$
Now, since $m - u(y) \leq 0$ in $\ocal$, $m<0$, $c\geq 0$, and $\overline{K}(x_0, y) \geq \overline{K}(x_0, y^\star)>0$ ---by \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality}---, we get
$$
0 \leq L_K  u(x_0) + c(x_0) u(x_0) \leq m \left(2\int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x_0, y^\star) \d y + c(x_0)\right)  < 0\,,
$$
a contradiction.

$(ii)$ 
Assume that $u \not \equiv 0$ in $\ocal$. We shall prove that $u > 0$ in $\Omega$. By contradiction, assume that there exists a point $x_0\in \Omega$ such that $u(x_0)= 0$. Then, using the expression of $L_K $ for odd functions given in Lemma~\ref{Lemma:OperatorOddF}, the kernel inequality \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality}, and the fact that $u\geq 0$ in $\ocal$, we obtain
$$
0 \leq L_K u(x_0) + c(x_0) u(x_0) = - \int_{\ocal} u(y)\big \{\overline{K}(x_0, y) - \overline{K}(x_0, y^\star) \big \}\d y < 0\,,
$$
a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Note that since the operator $L_K$ includes a term of order zero with positive coefficient in addition to the integro-differential part, the condition $c\geq 0$ in point $(i)$ of the previous proposition can be slightly relaxed. Indeed, following the proof of the result, we see that
$$ c(x) > -2\int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y $$
suffices.
This hypothesis seems hard to be checked for applications apart from the case $c\geq 0$. Nevertheless, recall that by Lemma~\ref{Lemma:OperatorOddF} we have an explicit lower bound for the quantity $ \int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y $ in terms of the function $\dist(x,\ccal)$. This fact will be crucial for establishing a maximum principle in ``narrow'' sets close to the Simons cone, .
