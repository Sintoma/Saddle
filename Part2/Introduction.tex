In this paper, which is the second part of \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}, we study saddle-shaped solutions to the semilinear equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}
L_K u = f(u) \quad \textrm{ in } \R^{2m},
\end{equation}
where $L_K$ is a linear integro-differential operator of the form \eqref{Eq:DefOfLu} and $f$ is of Allen-Cahn type ---see \eqref{Eq:Hypothesesf}. These  solutions (see Definition~\ref{Def:SaddleShapedSol} below) are particularly interesting in relation to the nonlocal version of a conjecture by De Giorgi, with the aim of finding a counterexample in high dimensions (see the details below). Moreover, this problem is related to the regularity theory of nonlocal minimal surfaces.

In the previous paper \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} we established an appropriate setting to study solutions to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn} which are doubly radial and odd with respect to the Simons cone (this terminology is described more precisely below), a property satisfied by saddle-shaped solutions. We deduced an alternative expression for the operator $L_K$ when acting on doubly radial odd functions ---see \eqref{Eq:OperatorOddF}. This expression was used to deduce some maximum principles for odd functions under certain assumptions on the kernel $K$ of the operator $L_K$. Moreover, we proved an energy estimate for doubly radial and odd minimizers of the energy associated to the equation, as well as the existence of saddle-shaped solutions to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}.

Using the results obtained in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}, in the present paper we further study saddle-shaped solutions to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}. First, we prove existence of this type of solutions, Theorem~\ref{Th:Existence}, by using the monotone iteration method (as an alternative to the proof in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} where variational methods are used). After this, we establish the asymptotic behavior of saddle-shaped solutions,  Theorem~\ref{Th:AsymptoticBehaviorSaddleSolution}. To do it, we use two symmetry results for semilinear equations similar to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}: Theorems~\ref{Th:SymmetryWholeSpace} and \ref{Th:SymmHalfSpace}, proved in Section~\ref{Sec:SymmetryResults}. In the study of the asymptotic behavior of saddle-shaped solutions we establish further properties of the so-called \emph{layer solution} $u_0$ (see Section~\ref{Sec:Asymptotic}). Finally, we show the uniqueness of the saddle-shaped solution, Theorem~\ref{Th:Uniqueness}, by using a maximum principle for the linearized operator $L_K - f'(u)$ (Proposition~\ref{Prop:MaximumPrincipleLinearized}).

 
As in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}, equation \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn} is driven by a linear integro-differential operator $L_K$ of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:DefOfLu}
L_K w(x) = \int_{\R^n} \{w(x) - w(y)\} K(x-y)\d y,
\end{equation}
where the kernel $K$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:Symmetry&IntegrabilityOfK}
K\geq 0\,, \quad K(y) = K(-y) \quad \textrm{ and } \quad \int_{\R^n} \min \left\{ |y|^2, 1 \right\} K(y) \d y < + \infty\,.
\end{equation}
The integral in \eqref{Eq:DefOfLu} has to be understood in the principal value sense, as well as all the integrals involving nonlocal operators in the rest of the paper.
The most canonical example of such operators is the fractional Laplacian
$$
\fraclaplacian w = c_{n, \s} \int_{\R^n} \dfrac{w(x) - w(y)}{|x-y|^{n + 2\s}}\d y\,,
$$
where $\s \in (0,1)$ and $c_{n, \s}$ is a normalizing constant given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{Eq:ConstantFracLaplacian}
  c_{n,\s} = \s\dfrac{2^{2\s} \Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+\s) }{\pi^{n/2} \Gamma(1-\s)},
\end{equation}
see for instance \cite{BucurValdinoci}.

Throughout the paper, we assume that the operator $L_K$ is uniformly elliptic. That is, its kernel is bounded from above and below by a positive multiple of the one of the fractional Laplacian:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:Ellipticity}
\lambda \dfrac{c_{n,\s}}{|y|^{n+2\s}} \leq K(y) \leq \Lambda\dfrac{c_{n,\s}}{|y|^{n+2\s}}\,, \quad \text{ with }  0< \lambda \leq \Lambda \,,
\end{equation}
where $c_{n,\s}$ is given in \eqref{Eq:ConstantFracLaplacian}. This condition is very frequently adopted when dealing with nonlocal operators of the form \eqref{Eq:DefOfLu} since it is known to yield HÃ¶lder regularity of solutions (see \cite{RosOton-Survey,SerraC2s+alphaRegularity} and Section~2). The family of linear operators satisfying conditions \eqref{Eq:Symmetry&IntegrabilityOfK} and \eqref{Eq:Ellipticity} is the so-called $\lcal_0(n,\s,\lambda, \Lambda)$ ellipticity class. For short we will usually write $\lcal_0$, and we will make explicit the parameters only when needed.

Following \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}, in this paper we will sometimes assume that the operator $L_K$ is rotational invariant, that is, that its kernel is radially symmetric. This extra assumption allows us to rewrite the operator in the setting of doubly radial odd functions, as explained in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}.

Note that, for operators in the class $\lcal_0$, the minimal assumption on $w$ so that $L_K w$ is well defined in an open set $\Omega$ is that $w\in C^\alpha (\Omega)\cap L^1_\s(\R^n)$ for some $\alpha > 2\s$, where $w\in L^1_\s(\R^n)$ means that
$$
\int_{\R^n} \dfrac{|w(x)|}{1+|x|^{n+2\s}}\d x < +\infty\,.
$$


Concerning the nonlinearity in \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}, we will assume that $f$ is a $C^1$ function satisfying
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:Hypothesesf}
f \textrm{ is odd, } \quad f(\pm 1)=0, \quad \text{ and } \quad f \textrm{ is strictly concave in }  (0,1).
\end{equation}
Note that this yields $f>0$ in $(0,1)$, $f'(0)>0$ and $f'(\pm 1) < 0$. A property of $f$ that will be used through the paper is that, since $f$ is strictly concave in $(0,1)$ and $f(0)=0$, then 
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:PropertyConcavityf}
f'(\tau)\tau < f(\tau) \quad \textrm{ for all } \tau \in (0,1)\,.
\end{equation}

Before introducing saddle-shaped solutions, we need to recall some definitions. First, we present the Simons cone, which is a central object along this paper. It is defined in $\R^{2m}$ by
%\begin{equation}
%\label{Eq:SimonsCone}
$$
\mathscr{C} := \setcond{x = (x', x'') \in \R^m \times \R^m = \R^{2m}}{|x'| = |x''|}\,.
%\end{equation}
$$
This cone is of importance in the theory of minimal surfaces. It has zero mean curvature at every point $x\in \ccal \setminus \{0\}$, in all even dimensions, and it is a minimizer of the perimeter functional when $2m\geq 8$. Concerning the nonlocal setting, $\ccal$ has also zero nonlocal mean curvature in all even dimensions, although it is not known if it is a minimizer of the nonlocal perimeter (see the introduction of \cite{Felipe-Sanz-Perela:SaddleFractional} and the references therein for more details).


As in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}, we will use the letters $\ocal$ and $\ical$ to denote each of the parts in which $\R^{2m}$ is divided by the cone $\ccal$:
$$
\ocal:= \setcond{x = (x', x'') \in \R^{2m}}{|x'| > |x''|} \ \textrm{ and } \
\ical:= \setcond{x = (x', x'') \in \R^{2m}}{|x'| < |x''|}.
$$
Both sets $\ocal$ and $\ical$ belong to a family of sets in $\R^{2m}$ which are called of \emph{double revolution}. They are sets that are invariant under orthogonal transformations in the first $m$ variables and also under orthogonal transformations in the last $m$ variables. That is, $\Omega\subset \R^{2m}$ is a set of double revolution if $R\Omega = \Omega$ for any given transformation $R\in O(m)^2 = O(m) \times O(m)$, where  $O(m)$ is the orthogonal group of $\R^m$.

In this paper we deal with functions that are \emph{doubly radial}. These are functions $w:\R^{2m}  \to \R$ that depend only on the modulus of the first $m$ variables and on the modulus of the last $m$ ones, i.e., $w(x) = w(|x'|,|x''|)$. Equivalently, $w(Rx) = w(x)$ for every $R \in O(m)^2$.

In order to define certain symmetries of a function with respect to the Simons cone, we consider the following isometry, that will play a significant role in this article:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:DefStar}
\begin{matrix}
(\cdot)^\star \colon & \R^{2m}= \R^{m}\times \R^{m}  &\to&  \R^{2m}= \R^{m}\times \R^{m}  \\
& x = (x',x'') &\mapsto & x^\star = (x'',x')\,.
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}
Note that this isometry is actually an involution that maps $\ocal$ into $\ical$ (and vice versa) and leaves the cone $\ccal$ invariant. Taking into account this transformation, we say that a doubly radial function $w$ is \emph{odd with respect to the Simons cone} if $w(x) = -w(x^\star)$ for every $x\in \R^{2m}$. Similarly, we say that a doubly radial function $w$ is \emph{even with respect to the Simons cone} if $w(x) = w(x^\star)$ for every $x\in \R^{2m}$.


With these definitions at hand we can now introduce saddle-shaped solutions.
\begin{definition}
	\label{Def:SaddleShapedSol}
	We say that a bounded solution $u$ to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn} is a \emph{saddle-shaped solution} (or simply \emph{saddle solution}) if
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $u$ is doubly radial.
		\item $u$ is odd with respect to the Simons cone.
		\item $u > 0$ in $\ocal = \{|x'| > |x''|\} $.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Note that these solutions are even with respect to the coordinate axis and that their zero level set is the Simons cone $\mathscr{C} = \{|x'|=|x''|\}$. 


Saddle-shaped solutions to the classical Allen-Cahn equation involving the Laplacian were studied in \cite{DangFifePeletier, Schatzman, CabreTerraI,CabreTerraII, Cabre-Saddle}. In these works, it was established the existence, uniqueness and some qualitative properties of this type of solutions, such as instability when $2m\leq 6$ and stability if $2m\geq 14$. The possible stability in dimensions $8$, $10$, and $12$ is still an open problem, as well as the possible minimality of this solution in dimensions $2m \geq 8$.


In the fractional framework, there are only three works concerning saddle-shaped solutions to the equation $\fraclaplacian u = f(u)$. In  \cite{Cinti-Saddle,Cinti-Saddle2}, Cinti proved the existence of a saddle-shaped solution as well as some qualitative properties such as asymptotic behavior, monotonicity properties, and instability in low dimensions. In a previous paper by the authors \cite{Felipe-Sanz-Perela:SaddleFractional}, further properties of these solutions were proved, the main ones being uniqueness and, when $2m\geq 14$, stability. Recall that we say that a bounded solution $w$ to $L_K w = f(w)$ in $\Omega\subset \R^n$ is \emph{stable} in $\Omega$ if the second variation of the energy at $w$ is nonnegative. That is, if
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:StablityCondition}  
\dfrac{1}{2} \int_{\R^n} \int_{\R^n} |\xi (x) - \xi(y)|^2 K(x - y) \d x \d y - \int_{\Omega} f'(w) \xi^2 \d x \geq 0
\end{equation}
for every $\xi \in C^\infty_0 (\Omega)$.


To our knowledge, the present paper together with its first part \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} are the first ones studying saddle-shaped solutions for general integro-differential equations of the form \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}. In the three previous papers \cite{Cinti-Saddle, Cinti-Saddle2, Felipe-Sanz-Perela:SaddleFractional}, the main tool used is the extension problem for the fractional Laplacian (see \cite{CaffarelliSilvestre}). Nevertheless, this technique has the limitation that it cannot be carried out for general integro-differential operators different from the fractional Laplacian. Therefore, some purely nonlocal techniques were developed in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} to study saddle-shaped solutions, and we exploit them in the present paper.

Let us collect now the main results of the previous paper \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} that will be used in the present one. Recall that, if $K$ is a radially symmetric kernel, then we can rewrite the operator $L_K$ acting on a doubly radial function $w$ as
$$
L_K w(x) = \int_{\R^{2m}} \{w(x) - w(y)\} \overline{K}(x,y) \d y\,,
$$
where $\overline{K}$ is doubly radial in both variables and is defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:KbarDef}
\overline{K}(x,y) := \average_{O(m)^2} K(|Rx - y|)\d R\,.
\end{equation}
Here, $\d R$ denotes integration with respect to the Haar measure on $O(m)^2$ (see Section~2 of \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} for the details).

Moreover, if we consider doubly radial functions that are odd with respect to the Simons cone, we can use the involution $(\cdot)^\star$ ---defined in \eqref{Eq:DefStar}---, to find that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:OperatorOddF}
L_K w (x) = \int_{\ocal} \{w(x) - w(y) \} \{\overline{K}(x, y) - \overline{K}(x, y^\star)  \} \d y +  2 w(x) \int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y \,.
\end{equation}
Furthermore,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:ZeroOrderTerm}
\frac{1}{C} \dist(x,\ccal)^{-2\s} \leq \int_{\ocal} \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \d y \leq C \dist(x,\ccal)^{-2\s},
\end{equation}
with $C>0$ depending only on $m, \s, \lambda$ and $\Lambda$ (see the details in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}).


Note that the expression \eqref{Eq:OperatorOddF} has an integro-differential part plus a zero order term with a positive coefficient. Thus, the natural assumption to make for that operator to have a maximum principle is that its ``kernel'' is positive. That is, $\overline{K}(x, y) - \overline{K}(x, y^\star)>0$. 

One of the main results in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} established necessary and sufficient conditions on the original kernel $K$ in order to $L_K$ have a maximum principle in $\ocal$ when acting on doubly radial functions which are odd with respect to the Simons cone. This is given in the next result.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}]
	\label{Th:SufficientNecessaryConditions}
	Let $K:(0,+\infty) \to (0,+\infty)$ and consider the radially symmetric kernel $K(|x-y|)$ in $\R^{2m}$. Define $\overline{K} : \R^{2m}\times \R^{2m} \to \R$ by \eqref{Eq:KbarDef}.
	
	If 
	\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:SqrtConvex}	
	K(\sqrt{\tau}) \text{ is a strictly convex function of }\tau\,,
	\end{equation}
	then $L_K$ has a positive kernel in $\ocal$ when acting on doubly radial functions which are odd with respect to the Simons cone $\ccal$. More precisely, it holds
	\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:KernelInequality}
	\overline{K}(x,y) > \overline{K}(x, y^\star) \quad \text{ for every }x,y \in \ocal\,.
	\end{equation}
	
	In addition, if $K\in C^2((0,+\infty))$, then \eqref{Eq:SqrtConvex} is not only a sufficient condition for \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality} to hold, but also a necessary one.
\end{theorem}


The positivity condition \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality} is the key ingredient to prove the first main result of this paper: the existence of saddle-shaped solution.

\begin{theorem}[Existence of saddle-shaped solution]
	\label{Th:Existence}
	Let $f$ satisfy \eqref{Eq:Hypothesesf}. Let $K$ be a radially symmetric kernel such that $L_K\in \lcal_0(2m, \s, \lambda, \Lambda)$ and satisfying the positivity condition \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality}. Then, for every even dimension $2m \geq 2$, there exists a saddle-shaped solution $u$ to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}. In addition, $u$ satisfies $|u|<1$ in $\R^{2m}$.
\end{theorem}

This theorem was already proved in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} using variational techniques. Here, instead, we use the monotone iteration method and the existence of a positive supersolution to a semilinear Dirichlet problem in a ball (see Section~\ref{Sec:Existence} for the details). Let us remark that in both methods it is crucial to have inequality \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality}.


The second main result of this paper is Theorem~\ref{Th:AsymptoticBehaviorSaddleSolution} below, on the asymptotic behavior of saddle-shaped solutions at infinity. Before state it, let us introduce an important type of solutions in the study of the integro-differential Allen-Cahn equation: the layer solutions.


We say that a solution $v$ to $L_K v = f(v)$ in $\R^n$ is a \emph{layer solution} if $v$ is increasing in one direction, say $e\in \Sph^{n-1}$ and $v(x) \to \pm 1$ as $x\cdot e \to \pm \infty$ (not necessarily uniformly). By a result of Cozzi and Passalacqua in \cite{CozziPassalacqua}, under the assumptions \eqref{Eq:Hypothesesf} on $f$, for every kernel $K_1$ such that $L_{K_1}\in \lcal_0(1,\s,\Lambda, \lambda)$ there exist a layer solution  to $L_{K_1} w = f(w)$ in $\R$ which is unique up to translations and is odd with respect to some point (in the case of the fractional Laplacian this result was proved in \cite{CabreSolaMorales,CabreSireII} by using the extension problem).

In $\R^n$, a special case of layer solutions are the one-dimensional ones. Actually, in relation with the available results concerning a conjecture by De Giorgi, in low dimensions all layer solutions are one-dimensional (see the comments at the end of this introduction). One-dimensional layer solutions in $\R^n$ are in correspondence with the ones in $\R$ as explained next ---see also \cite{CozziPassalacqua}. Let $v$ be a layer solution to $L_K v = f(v)$ in $\R^n$ depending only on one direction, say $v(x) = w(x_n)$, and assume that $L_{K}\in \lcal_0(n,\s,\Lambda, \lambda)$. Then $w$ is a layer solution to $L_{K_1} w = f(w)$ in $\R$ with $K_1$ given by
$$
K_1(t) := \int_{\R^{n-1}} K\left(\theta,t\right) \d \theta = |t|^{n-1} \int_{\R^{n-1}} K\left(t\sigma,t\right) \d \sigma.
$$
Moreover $L_{K_1}\in \lcal_0(1,\s,\Lambda, \lambda)$. For more details see Proposition~\ref{Prop:KernelsDimension} in Section~\ref{Sec:Asymptotic} and \cite{CozziPassalacqua}. 

A particular layer solution, denoted by $u_0$, plays an important role in this paper. It is defined to be the unique solution of the following problem.
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:LayerSolution}
\beqc{\PDEsystem}
L_{K_1}  u_0 &=& f(u_0) & \textrm{ in }\R\,,\\
\dot{u}_0 &>& 0 & \textrm{ in } \R\,,\\
u_0(x) & = &-u_0(-x)  & \textrm{ in }\R\,,\\
\ds \lim_{x \to \pm \infty} u_0(x) &=& \pm 1. & 
\eeqc
\end{equation}
Note that, by the previous comments, $v(x) = u_0(x_n)$ is a one-dimensional layer solution to $L_K v = f(v)$ in $\R^n$. Moreover, the same holds for $u_0(x\cdot e)$ for every $e\in \Sph^{n-1}$ whenever the kernel is radially symmetric.

The importance of the layer solution $u_0$ in relation with saddle-shaped solutions is that the associated function
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:DefOfU}
U(x):= u_0 \left( \dfrac{|x'| - |x''|}{\sqrt{2}} \right)\,
\end{equation}
describes the asymptotic behavior of saddle solutions at infinity. Note that $(|x'| - |x''| )/\sqrt{2}$ is the signed distance to the Simons cone (see Lemma~4.2 in \cite{CabreTerraII}). Therefore, we can understand the function $U$ as the layer solution $u_0$ centered at each point of the Simons cone and oriented in the normal direction to the cone.

The precise statement on the asymptotic behavior of saddle-shaped solutions at infinity is the following.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{Th:AsymptoticBehaviorSaddleSolution}
	Let $f\in C^2(\R)$ satisfy \eqref{Eq:Hypothesesf}. Let $K$ be a radially symmetric kernel such that $L_K\in \lcal_0(2m, \s, \lambda, \Lambda)$ and satisfying the positivity condition \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality}. Let $u$ be a saddle-shaped solution to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}. Let $U$ be the function defined by \eqref{Eq:DefOfU}.
	
	Then,
	$$
	\norm{u-U}_{L^\infty(\R^n\setminus B_R)}
	+\norm{\nabla u-\nabla U}_{L^\infty(\R^n\setminus B_R)}
	+\norm{D^2u-D^2U}_{L^\infty(\R^n\setminus B_R)} \to 0
	$$
	as $ R\to +\infty$.
\end{theorem}

To establish the asymptotic behavior of saddle-shaped solutions we use a compactness argument as in \cite{CabreTerraII, Cinti-Saddle, Cinti-Saddle2} and we need two important symmetry results established in Section~\ref{Sec:SymmetryResults}. The first one, Theorem~\ref{Th:SymmetryWholeSpace}, is a symmetry result for nonnegative solutions to a semilinear equation in the whole space. 

\begin{theorem}
	\label{Th:SymmetryWholeSpace}
	Let $L_K \in \lcal_0(n,\s)$ and let $v$ be a bounded solution to
	\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:PositiveWholeSpace}
	\beqc{\PDEsystem}
	L_K v &=& f(v) & \textrm{ in }\R^n\,,\\
	v &\geq& 0 & \textrm{ in } \R^n\,,
	\eeqc
	\end{equation}
	with the nonlinearity $f\in C^1$ satisfying
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $f(0) = f(1) = 0$,
		\item $f'(0)>0$,
		\item $f>0$ in $(0,1)$, and
		\item $f<0$ in $(1,+\infty)$.
	\end{itemize}
	Then, $v\equiv 0$ or $v \equiv 1$.
\end{theorem}

Similar classification results have been proved for the fractional Laplacian in \cite{ChenLiZhang,LiZhang} (either using the extension problem or not) with the method of moving spheres, which uses crucially the scale invariance of the operator $\fraclaplacian$. To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar result available in the literature for general kernels in the ellipticity class $\lcal_0$ (which are not necessarily scale invariant). Thus, we present here a proof based on the techniques used in \cite{BerestyckiHamelNadi} for a local equation with the classical Laplacian. It relies on the maximum principle and the translation invariance of the operator (combined with a Harnack inequality and a stability argument), and thus can be carried out for all operators in $\lcal_0$.

The second one is a symmetry result for equations in a half-space. Here we use the notation $\R^n_+= \{(x_H,x_n)\in \R^{n-1}\times \R \text{ such that } x_n > 0\}$.  \todo{Notacion}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{Th:SymmHalfSpace}
	Let $L_K\in \lcal_0(n,\s)$ and let $v$ be a bounded solution to one of these two problems:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\leqnomode
	\tag{P1}
	\label{Eq:P1}
	\beqc{\PDEsystem}
	L_K v &=& f(v)   &\textrm{ in } \,\R^n_+,\\
	v &>& 0   &\textrm{ in } \,\R^n_+,\\
	v(x_H,x_n) &=& -v(x_H,-x_n)   &\textrm{ in } \,\R^n.
	\eeqc
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
	\leqnomode
	\tag{P2}
	\label{Eq:P2}
	\beqc{\PDEsystem}
	L_K v &=& f(v)   &\textrm{ in } \,\R^n_+,\\
	v &>& 0   &\textrm{ in } \,\R^n_+,\\
	v &=& 0   &\textrm{ in } \,\R^n \setminus \R^n_+.
	\eeqc
	\end{equation}
	
	\reqnomode
	
	Assume that, in $\R^n_+$, the kernel $K$ of the operator $L_K$ is decreasing in the direction of $x_n$, that is, it satisfies
	$$
	K(x_H-y_H,x_n-y_n) \geq K(x_H-y_H,x_n+y_n) \,\,\,\,\text{for all } \,\, x,y\in \R^n_+.
	$$ 
	Suppose that the nonlinearity $f\in C^1$ and
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $f(0) = f(1) = 0$,
		\item $f'(0)>0$, and $f'(t)\leq 0$ for all $t\in[1-\delta,1]$ for some $\delta>0$,
		\item $f>0$ in $(0,1)$, and
		\item $f$ is odd in the case of \eqref{Eq:P1}.
	\end{itemize}
	Then, $v$ depends only on $x_n$ and it is increasing in that direction.
\end{theorem}

The result for \eqref{Eq:P2} has been proved for the fractional Laplacian under some assumptions on $f$ (weaker than the ones in Theorem~\ref{Th:SymmHalfSpace}) in \cite{QuaasXia, BarriosEtAl-Monotonicity, BarriosEtAl-Symmetry, FallWethMonotonicity}. Instead, to the best of our knowledge \eqref{Eq:P1} has not been treated even for the fractional Laplacian. In our case, the fact that $f$ is of Allen-Cahn type allows us to use rather simple arguments that work for both problems \eqref{Eq:P1} and \eqref{Eq:P2} ---moving planes and sliding methods. Moreover, the fact that we replace the kernel of the operator by a general $K$ satisfying \eqref{Eq:Ellipticity} do not affect significantly the proof. Although \eqref{Eq:P2} will not be used in this paper, we state it and prove it here for future reference, since the proof is analogous to the one of \eqref{Eq:P1}.

The last main result of this paper is the uniqueness of the saddle-shaped solution, stated next.

\begin{theorem}[Uniqueness of the saddle-shaped solution]
	\label{Th:Uniqueness}
	Let $f$ satisfy \eqref{Eq:Hypothesesf} and let $K$ be a radially symmetric kernel such that $L_K\in \lcal_0(2m, \s, \lambda, \Lambda)$ and satisfying the positivity condition \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality}. Then, for every dimension $2m \geq 2$, there exists a unique saddle-shaped solution to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn}.
\end{theorem}

To prove this result we need two ingredients. The first one is the asymptotic behavior of saddle solutions given in Theorem~\ref{Th:AsymptoticBehaviorSaddleSolution}. The second one is a maximum principle in $\ocal$ for the linearized operator $L_K - f'(u)$, which is given in Proposition~\ref{Prop:MaximumPrincipleLinearized}. To establish it, we will need to use a maximum principle in ``narrow'' sets that we also prove in Section~\ref{Sec:MaximumPrinciple}.

To conclude this introduction, let us make some comments on the importance of problem \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn} and its relation with the theory of (classical and nonlocal) minimal surfaces and  a famous conjecture raised by De Giorgi.

A main open problem (even in the local case) is to determine whether the saddle-shaped solution is a minimizer of the energy functional associated to the equation, depending on the dimension $2m$. This question is deeply related to the regularity theory of local and nonlocal minimal surfaces, as explained next.

In the seventies, Modica and Mortola (see \cite{Modica,ModicaMortola}) proved that, considering an appropriately rescaled version of the (local) Allen-Cahn equation, the corresponding energy functionals $\Gamma$-converge to the perimeter functional. Thus, the minimizers of the equation converge to the characteristic function of a set of minimal perimeter. This same fact holds for the equation with the fractional Laplacian, though we have two different scenarios depending on the parameter $\s \in (0,1)$. If $\s \geq 1/2$, the rescaled energy functionals associated to the equation $\Gamma$-converge to the classical perimeter (see \cite{GiovanniBouchitteSeppecher,Gonzalez}), while in the case $\s \in (0,1/2)$ they $\Gamma$-converge to the fractional perimeter (see \cite{SavinValdinoci-GammaConvergence}). As a consequence, if the saddle-shaped solution was proved to be a minimizer in a certain dimension for some $\s \in (0,1/2)$, it would follow that the Simons cone $\ccal$ would be a minimizing nonlocal $(2\s)$-minimal surface in such dimensions. This last statement on the saddle-shaped solution is an open problem in any dimension (although it is known that the Simons cone is not a minimizer in dimension $2m=2$). The only available result related to this question is the recent result in \cite{Felipe-Sanz-Perela:SaddleFractional} that states that the saddle-shaped solution to the fractional Allen-Cahn equation is stable in dimensions $2m\geq 14$. As a consequence of this and a result in \cite{CabreCintiSerra-Stable}, the Simons cone is a stable nonlocal $(2\s)$-minimal surface in dimensions $ 2m\geq 14$ (see the details in \cite{Felipe-Sanz-Perela:SaddleFractional}).


Moreover, as explained below, saddle-shaped solutions are natural objects to build a counterexample to a famous conjecture raised by De Giorgi, that reads as follows. Let $u$ be a bounded solution to $-\Delta  u = u - u^3$ in $\R^n$ which is monotone in one direction, say $\partial_{x_n} u > 0$. Then, if $n\leq 8$, $u$ is one dimensional, i.e., $u$ depends only on one Euclidean variable. This conjecture was proved to be true in dimensions $n=2$ and  $n=3$ (see \cite{GhoussoubGui,AmbrosioCabre}), and in dimensions $4\leq n \leq 8$ with the extra assumption of
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:SavinCondition}
\lim_{x_n \to \pm \infty} u(x',x_n) = \pm 1 \quad \text{ for all } x'\in \R^{n-1}\,,
\end{equation}
(see \cite{Savin-DeGiorgi}). A counterexample to the conjecture in dimensions $n\geq 9$ was given in \cite{delPinoKowalczykWei} by using the gluing method. 

An alternative approach to the one of \cite{delPinoKowalczykWei} to construct a counterexample to the conjecture was given by Jerison and Monneau in \cite{JerisonMonneau}. They showed that a counterexample in $\R^{n+1}$ can be constructed with a rather natural procedure if there exists a global minimizer of $-\Delta u = f(u)$ in $\R^n$ which is bounded and even with respect to each coordinate but is not one-dimensional. The saddle-shaped solution is of special interest in the search for this counterexample, since it is even with respect to all the coordinate axis and it is canonically associated to the Simons cone, which in turn is the simplest nonplanar minimizing minimal surface. Therefore, by proving that the saddle solution to the classical Allen-Cahn equation is a minimizer in some dimension $2m$, one would obtain automatically a counterexample to the conjecture in $\R^{2m+1}$.

The corresponding conjecture in the fractional setting, where one replaces the operator $-\Delta$ by $\fraclaplacian$, has been widely studied in the last years. In this framework, the conjecture has been proven to be true for all $\s\in(0,1)$ in dimensions $n=2$ (see \cite{CabreSolaMorales,CabreSireI,SireValdinoci}) and $n=3$ (see \cite{CabreCinti-EnergyHalfL, CabreCinti-SharpEnergy,DipierroFarinaValdinoci}). The conjecture is also true in dimension $n=4$ in the case of $\s = 1/2$ (see \cite{FigalliSerra}) and if $\s\in(0,1/2)$ is close to $1/2$ (see \cite{CabreCintiSerra-Stable}). Assuming the additional hypothesis \eqref{Eq:SavinCondition}, the conjecture is true in dimensions $4\leq n \leq 8$ for $1/2 \leq \s < 1$ (see \cite{Savin-Fractional,Savin-Fractional2}), and also for $\s\in(0,1/2)$ if $\s$ is close to $1/2$ (see \cite{DipierroSerraValdinoci}). A counterexample to the De Giorgi conjecture for the fractional Allen-Cahn equation in dimensions $n \geq 9$ for $\s \in (1/2,1)$ has been very recently announced in \cite{ChanLiuWei}.

Concerning the conjecture with more general operators like $L_K$, fewer results are known. In dimension $n=2$ the conjecture is proved in \cite{HamelRosOtonSireValdinoci, Bucur, FazlySire}, under different assumptions on the kernel $K$ and even for more general nonlinear operators. Note also that the results of \cite{DipierroSerraValdinoci} also hold for a particular class of kernels in $\lcal_0$.



The paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{Sec:Preliminaries} we present some preliminary results that will be used in the rest of the article. Section~\ref{Sec:Existence} contains the proof of Theorem~\ref{Th:Existence} on the existence of saddle-shaped solutions. In Section~\ref{Sec:SymmetryResults} we establish two symmetry results, Theorems~\ref{Th:SymmetryWholeSpace} and \ref{Th:SymmHalfSpace}. Section~\ref{Sec:Asymptotic} is devoted to the layer solution $u_0$ of problem \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn} and the proof of the asymptotic behavior of saddle-shaped solutions, Theorem~\ref{Th:AsymptoticBehaviorSaddleSolution}. Finally, Section~\ref{Sec:MaximumPrinciple} concerns the proof of a maximum principle in $\ocal$ for the linearized operator $L_K - f'(u)$ (Proposition~\ref{Prop:MaximumPrincipleLinearized}), as well as the proof of Theorem~\ref{Th:Uniqueness}, establishing the uniqueness of the saddle-shaped solution.
