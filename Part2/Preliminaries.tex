In this section we collect some preliminary results that will be used in the rest of this paper. First, we state the regularity results needed in the forthcoming sections. Then, we present the functional setting which we are going to work with and finally we recall the two basic maximum principles for doubly radial odd functions proved in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}.

\subsection{Regularity theory for nonlocal operators in the class $\lcal_0$}
\label{Subsec:Regularity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


In this subsection we present the regularity results that will be used in the paper. For further details, see \cite{RosOton-Survey,SerraC2s+alphaRegularity} and the references therein. 


We start with a result on the interior regularity for linear equations.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{RosOton-Survey,SerraC2s+alphaRegularity}]
	\label{Prop:InteriorRegularity}
	Let $L_K \in\lcal_0(n,\s,\lambda, \Lambda)$ and let $w\in L^\infty (\R^n)$ be a weak solution to $L_K w = h$ in $B_1$. Then,
	\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:C2sEstimate}
	\norm{w}_{C^{2\s} (B_{1/2})} \leq C\bpar{\norm{h}_{L^\infty (B_1)} + \norm{w}_{L^\infty  (\R^n)} }.
	\end{equation}
	Moreover, let $\alpha > 0$ and assume additionally that $w \in C^\alpha (\R^n)$. Then, if $\alpha +
	2\s$ is not an integer,
	\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:Calpha->Calpha+2sEstimate}
	\norm{w}_{C^{\alpha + 2\s} (B_{1/2})} \leq C\bpar{\norm{h}_{C^{\alpha} (B_1)} + \norm{w}_{C^\alpha (\R^n)} },
	\end{equation}
	where $C$ is a constant that depends only on $n$, $\s$, $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$.
\end{proposition}


Throughout the paper we consider saddle solutions $u$ to \eqref{Eq:NonlocalAllenCahn} that satisfy $|u|\leq 1$ in $\R^n$. Hence, by applying \eqref{Eq:C2sEstimate} we find that for any $x_0\in \R^n$,
\begin{align*}
\norm{u}_{C^{2\s} (B_{1/2} (x_0))} &\leq C\bpar{\norm{f(u)}_{L^\infty (B_1(x_0))} + \norm{u}_{L^\infty  (\R^n)} } \\
&\leq C\bpar{1 + \norm{f}_{L^\infty ([-1,1])} }.
\end{align*}
Note that the estimate is independent of the point $x_0$, and thus since the equation is satisfied in the whole $\R^n$,
$$
\norm{u}_{C^{2\s}(\R^n)} \leq C\bpar{1 + \norm{f}_{L^\infty ([-1,1])} }.
$$
Then, we use estimate \eqref{Eq:Calpha->Calpha+2sEstimate} repeatedly and the same kind of arguments wield that, if $f\in C^{k}([-1,1])$, then $u\in C^{\alpha}(\R^n)$ for some $\alpha > k+ 2 \s$. Moreover, the following estimate holds:
$$
\norm{u}_{C^{\alpha}(\R^n)} \leq C\,,
$$
for some constant $C$ depending only on $n$, $\s$, $\lambda$, $\Lambda$, $k$ and $\norm{f}_{C^k([-1,1])}$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Functional setting}
\label{Subsec:Functional setting}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



In this section we define the functional spaces that we are going to consider in some parts of this paper. These were also the spaces used in the previous article \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}, and we refer the reader to that work for more details.

Given a set $\Omega \subset \R^n$ and a translation invariant and positive kernel $K$ satisfying \eqref{Eq:Symmetry&IntegrabilityOfK}, we define the space
$$
\H^K(\Omega) := \setcond{w \in L^2(\Omega)}{[w]^2_{\H^K(\Omega)} < + \infty},
$$
where
$$
[w]^2_{\H^K(\Omega)} := \dfrac{1}{2}\int\int_{\R^{2n} \setminus (\R^n\setminus\Omega)^2} |w(x) - w(y)|^2 K(x-y) \d x \d y\,.
$$
We also define
\begin{align*}
\H^K_0(\Omega) &:= \setcond{w \in \H^K(\Omega)}{ w = 0 \quad \textrm{a.e. in } \R^n \setminus \Omega} \\
&\ = \setcond{w \in \H^K(\R^n)}{ w = 0 \quad \textrm{a.e. in } \R^n \setminus \Omega}.
\end{align*}

Assume that $\Omega \subset \R^{2m}$ is a domain of double revolution. Then, we define
$$
\widetilde{\H}^K(\Omega) := \setcond{w \in \H^K(\Omega)}{w \textrm{ is doubly radial a.e.}}.
$$
and
$$
\widetilde{\H}^K_0(\Omega) := \setcond{w \in \H^K_0(\Omega)}{w \textrm{ is doubly radial a.e.}}.
$$
We will add the subscript `odd' and `even' to these spaces to consider only functions that are odd (respectively even) with respect to the Simons cone.

Recall that when $K$ satisfies \eqref{Eq:Ellipticity}, then $\H^K_0 (\Omega) = \H^\s_0 (\Omega)$, which is the space associated to the kernel of the fractional Laplacian, $K(y) = c_{n,\s}|y|^{-n-2\s}$. Furthermore, $\H^\s(\Omega) \subset H^\s(\Omega)$, the usual fractional Sobolev space (see \cite{HitchhikerGuide,CozziPassalacqua}).

\subsection{Maximum principles for doubly radial odd functions}
\label{Subsec:MaxPrinciples}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this last subsection, we state two basic maximum principles for doubly radial odd functions. Note that in both results we only need assumptions on the functions at one side of the Simons cone thanks to their symmetry. Both results where proved in \cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI} using the key inequality \eqref{Eq:KernelInequality} for the kernel $\overline{K}$.

The first result is a weak maximum principle for odd functions with respect to $\ccal$.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}]
	\label{Prop:WeakMaximumPrincipleForOddFunctions} Let $\Omega \subset \ocal$ an open set and let $L_K  \in \lcal_\star (2m,  \s)$.  Let $w\in C^{\alpha}(\Omega)\cap L^\infty(\R^{2m})$, with $\alpha > 2\s$, be a doubly radial function which is odd with respect to the Simons cone. Assume that
	$$
	\beqc{\PDEsystem}
	L_K w & \geq & 0 & \text{ in } \Omega\,,\\
	w & \geq & 0 & \text{ in } \ocal \setminus \Omega\,,
	\eeqc
	$$
	and that either
	$$
	\Omega \text{ is bounded} \quad \text{ or } \liminf_{x \in \ocal,\,|x|\to +\infty} w(x) \geq 0\,.
	$$
	Then, $w \geq 0$ in $\Omega$.
\end{proposition}


The second result is the strong maximum principle for odd functions with respect to $\ccal$.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{FelipeSanz-Perela:IntegroDifferentialI}]
	\label{Prop:StrongMaximumPrincipleForOddFunctions} Let $\Omega \subset \ocal$ an open set and let $L_K  \in \lcal_\star (2m,  \s)$.  Let $w\in C^{\alpha}(\Omega)\cap L^\infty(\R^{2m})$, with $\alpha > 2\s$, be a doubly radial function which is odd with respect to the Simons cone. Assume that $L_K w \geq 0$ in $\Omega$, and that $w\geq 0$ in $\ocal$. Then, either $w\equiv 0$ or $w > 0$ in $\Omega$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
	\label{Remark:MaxPrincipleSingularity}
	The regularity assumptions on $w$ in the previous results can be weakened allowing $L_K w$ to take the value $+\infty$ at the points of $\Omega$ where $w$ is not regular enough for $L_K w$ to be finite. This will be used in the proof of Theorem~\ref{Th:Existence} in order to apply this maximum principle with a function that is no more regular than $C^\s$.
\end{remark}
